Flexcore is a powerful and feature-rich UI framework designed to simplify the process of building stunning and responsive web interfaces. With its extensive set of utilities, Flexcore offers a flexible and efficient solution for building web applications of any scale or complexity.

## Key Features ‚ú®

* **Utility-First**: Flexcore provides an extensive collection of utility classes that you can use to style your elements. These classes cover a wide range of properties like spacing, typography, colors, flexbox, and more, giving you granular control over the appearance of your UI.

* **Customization**: You can configure the framework's colors to match your project's design system. This flexibility allows you to create unique and consistent designs.

* **Responsive Design**: Flexcore includes responsive utility prefixes, allowing you to create responsive layouts and adapt your design to different screen sizes. With classes like sm, md, lg, and xl, you can easily customize styles based on breakpoints.
